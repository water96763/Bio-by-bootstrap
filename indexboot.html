                    <p>I came to Los Angeles to attend pharmacy school at USC and have been here ever since. I am currently a pharmacist licensed in California and Nevada. My full time job is with the State of California as an inspector. I investigate consumer complaints, perform inspections to ensure compliance with the law, perform interviews, audits, and testify in court. Periodically our agency works with other groups such as the DEA, FBI, ICE and HALT. My second job is as a pharmacist at a local hospital, where I perform sterile compounding, adjust and dispense medications and manage technicians. 
                    <br>
                    While in Los Angeles, I got my motorcycle license and learned to scuba. I have a 13-year old greyhound named Mango. I have been Yelp! elite for 4 years, but haven't been to many events. 
                    <br>
                    I am currently learning Full Stack Web Developing. It's always been an interest of mine, and I hope to put it to good use at my current job, but eventually I want to make it my full time job.
